         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is not for any other Satisfaction ſo important, as the diſcharge of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God and your ſouls, that puts me upon this dangerous adventure of writing unto you at this time. Wherein I do apparently hazard more, as to all ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reſpects and aimes, then any byaſſed advantage can compenſate. But as it was S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s pious care to write Epiſtles unto thoſe places where he had formerly Preached; ſo it ſhall be mine, chuſing rather to ſpeak unto you by my Pen, then not at all.</p>
            <p>It is now almoſt eight yeers ſince I had the freedom of ſpeaking unto you as your Spiritual Embaſſador from Chriſt. The ſufferings, hazards, and extremities I
<pb facs="tcp:153007:5"/> have undergone ſince that time, for the preſervation of my heart from a deliberate wound (though it be the matter of much Spiritual joy and thanksgiving, as the higheſt honour that poor fleſh and blood is capable of in this vale of miſery) yet to waſte any of this Paper in a particular Narrative thereof, would ſavour more of a mendicant deſigne, then of that ſincere advice I intend unto you. 'Tis enough ye know, that God hath hitherto preſerved and ſupported me by his unſpeakable mercy and goodneſs; and I hope (in his ſecret wiſdom) hath reſerved me for his further ſervice, in the place where he once ſet me. In the mean time, I hope a well meaning man, who hath been peaceable and faithful in our Iſrael, <hi>1 Sam. 20. 19.</hi> may have leave to publiſh thoſe ſerious Conceptions which are within his heart, like wine that hath no vent, <hi>Job 32. 19.</hi> and can no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with duty and Conſcience be ſuppreſſed.</p>

            <p>For, give me leave to argue and conclude no otherwiſe then the Scripture does.

Act. 8.</hi> and are not thoſe men guilty of their Soveraigns blood, who by their clamorous Petitions cried aloud; firſt, for no Treaty with him, and afterward
<pb facs="tcp:153007:16"/> no mercy on him? and ſince have ſeized, not his rayment only, but alſo his revenue; and are reſolv'd to do as much by the heyr (if God preſerve him not) that the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance may be ſetled in themſelves? What difference was there (in point of guilt) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the hands that drave the nails in our Saviours crucifixion, and the bold Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that ſtood by to maintain the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? What difference between the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that were upon the ſcaffold where our Soveraign was murthered, and thoſe which ſtood under the ſcaffold, and drew their ſwords in approbation of that fatal ſtroke, which at once cut off the head of our King, and diſmantled the Peace and felicity of his three Kingdoms? Or what difference between thoſe that then drew their ſwords in approbation of that horrid fact; and thoſe that now draw their ſwords in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of thoſe viſible betrayers and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers? ſure if there be any difference, the laſt are by much the deeper delinquents; for <hi>Non ſemper corrupta eſt mens male ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantis, at ſemper corrupta eſt male defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentis.</hi> The mind of him that worketh evil
<pb facs="tcp:153007:16"/> is not alwaies corrupt, but the mind of him that defendeth evil, is alwaies corrupt. And the reaſon why this ſin is ſo fearful and deſparate, is, becauſe when a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends and juſtifies a wickedneſs (knowing it to be ſuch) its a certain ſigne that his judgement and conſcience are both corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted; inſomuch, that he hath neither eys to ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it, nor heart to be touched with the guilt and horror of it.</p>
            <p>But youl ſay perhaps, our hearts did ever abhor the taking away the last Kings life, (for I instance in that only as the moſt notorious addition to all other evils) and were our hearts legible at preſent, it would be ſeen how zealous we are for ſetling the preſent King in his juſt power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

            <p>Theſe, I preſume, are the thoughts of ſome of you, for I have heard them from your own mouths: Truly, you have great reaſon to do ſomthing extraordinary for your King, if for no other reaſon, but to out do what you have done; but I have great

<pb facs="tcp:153007:20"/> things unto friends or poſterity, that ſtand before your trembling eys, but as ſo many witneſſes and remembrancers of guilt and iniquity? with what comfort or Conſcience can you diſpoſe of your Eſtates, when you know not what to do with your immortal ſouls? how is it poſſible you ſhould ſet your houſe in order, when your better part (your mind, which ſhould do it) is in the greateſt diſorder and diſtraction? when all that you have graſped by the hand of Power and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, ſhall not be able (in the leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) to releaſe you of the horror and amaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherewith your mercenary ſouls will be ſurpriſed. Therefore if any accurſed gain ſtick to your fingers, my advice is very ſhort, but withal ſafe, and I hope, not unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; <hi>Make to your ſelves friends of the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs, that when ye fail, ye may be received into everlaſting habitations. Matth. 16. 9.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt objection I foreſee, is very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and very deſperate, and runs parallel with that of Cain and Judas; <hi>Mine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is greater then can be forgiven.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, if you ſet your ſelves before the
<pb facs="tcp:153007:20"/> glaſs of Gods law, and look upon your ſelves with an impartial ey (as God looks on you) you have reaſon enough to be highly diſple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with your uglineſs and deformity. Or if you ſuffer your actions to be ſcanned and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Municipal Laws you were born under, which are the beſt ſecurity you have for any propriety, you cannot but diſcern your Perſons and Eſtates (in juſtice) to lie at the mercy of Confiſcation and Cenſure. But yet, for you to ſtand ſo much in your own light, as to turn your backs upon all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of Grace and Mercy, and to prefer your own guilty fears before your Princes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, is to add more weight to the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your injured Soveraign. To conclude him ſevere, becauſe you are pre-reſolv'd not to tast of his benignity, is an high breach of Charity and Gratitude; But to ſay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your ſelves, <hi>Nolumus hunc regnare,</hi> for no other reaſon, but becauſe you adhere to thoſe who killed his ſervants, murdered his royal Father, and ſeized on his inheritance, is cleerly and undoubtedly to rebel, not only against his Prerogative (the means of your Protection) but againſt the Goſpel it ſelf,
<pb facs="tcp:153007:21"/> the means of your ſalvation; and inſteed of giving God and Ceſar their due; you do at once d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ny King and your Chriſt together.</p>
            <p>I rather wiſh and pray, that you may learn of Benhadads ſervants, a ſafer way to peace and reconciliation; <hi>Behold</hi> (ſay thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens) <hi>we have heard that the kings of the houſe of Iſrael are merciful kings;</hi> and therefore they reſolve to addreſs themſelves to the king in a poſture of humiliation. And ſo will you (I hope) if you are not bewitch'd into your own ruine. You have a merciful king to deal withal; one, who is <hi>bone of your bone, and fleſh of your fleſh;</hi> One, in whom the heroick ſpirit of his Grandfather Henry 4th of France; the peaceable mind of his Grandfather K. James, and the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inclinations of his martyr'd father, do all concur to make up an incomparable king: who (when we are tyred and jaded with diſputes) muſt at last be truſted, or can be no king; and is not in a capacity to ſhew mercy, till he hath power to do otherwiſe. For, <hi>where the word of a King is, there is power</hi> ſaith Solomon; and without that power, mercy is not mercy, but ſervile and ſlaviſh compliance.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:153007:21"/>
            <p>So that if there were nothing to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in defence of the Regal power, or in demand of the Subjects duty, yet judge <hi>within your ſelves whether it is better for you that all the ſons of Jerubbaal</hi> (which are more then <hi>70. raign over you;</hi> or elſe, that the natural head be reſtored to the body, for the preſervation and reſt auration of our languiſhing gaſping Church &amp; State? Whether it be better to return to our former Laws and Government, or remainunder a perpetual fluctuation of Arbytrarie Power, which rowls from one faction to another, &amp; the wiſeſt among us cannot imagine where it will ſettle? Whether one form of doctrine and Diſcipline, or a thouſand Hereſies and Schiſms be the better Religion? Whether one King or fifty Colonels is like to produce the more ſafe and quiet Government?</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of ſome who adhered to Saul (who was none of the beſt kings) that <hi>they were a band of men whoſe hearts God had touched;</hi> but for thoſe that deſpiſed him, and brought him no preſents, they are branded with the name of <hi>children of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial.</hi> And in another place, we read of a
<pb facs="tcp:153007:22"/> fierce conteſtation between the men of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and the men of Judah, who ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the greateſt zeal in bringing the king to his royal Throne; oh, that it might pleaſe the God of Peace and Order, to cloſe all our unnatural and bloody differences in ſuch a ſweet emulation and agreement, that the laſt conteſtation among us, might be that of outvying one another in the ſeaſonable expreſſions of duty and allegiance; that our Abſoloms, and Sheba's, and Achitophels, &amp; which are worſe then theſe, our ſins, being ſuppreſt; we would be as zealous and active in reſtoring the Throne of Gods Anointed, as we have been fatal and unfortunate in the demoliſhing of it; without which I fear the youngeſt amongſt us will never live to ſee the ſettlement of Truth and Peace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any firm and aſſured foundation. And though his Majeſties preſent condition will not enable him <hi>to give you fields and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and to make you Captains of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and of hundreds;</hi> yet the villany of theſe times hath not ſtript him of all power and capacity to reward; for he hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Pardon, for ſuch as ſhall ſubmit
<pb facs="tcp:153007:22"/> themſelves, and return to their allegiance; which perhaps, may be worth the looking after once in ſeven yeers, as things may fall out. And he hath a reward of Bounty and Benignity, a reward of Merit, for ſuch as ſhall act remarkably in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; which if any man believe not, I ſhall ſuſpect him haunted and purſued into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of mercy, by the clamouring horrors of his own guilty Conſcience. And when any of you (my Pariſhioners) ſhall deſire to make tryal of, I doubt not but I am ſo well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood at Court, as to procure you an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment of the Kings mercy, whenſoever you ſhall look after it in the way of duty and allegiance. But if you ſhall ſay, That all is well done which hath been done of late yeers; that the foundation of thoſe glorious days which ſome of you dream of, is well &amp; ſafely laid in Perjury and Sacriledge, and the blood of your Soveraign, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, nor will not deny the right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and aſſiſtance to thoſe whom you take to be the Patriots and Protectors of your new form'd Commonwealth. And that I might very well have ſpared my pains in
<pb facs="tcp:153007:23"/> diſquieting your thoughts with ſtrange do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, hard ſayings, and ſad reflections on what is past; being reſolved aforehand, not to be diverted out of the way you are in. To ſuch, I have no more to ſay, but to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my grief and ſorrow of heart, for the ſtrong Deluſion and Infatuation wherein they are involved; <hi>My ſoul ſhall weep in ſecret for them; and God forbid I ſhould ſin againſt the Lord in ceaſing to pray for them,</hi> while they are on this ſide t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And for thoſe of my own Coat, if I have dealt unſeemly with them, in diſcovering the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs of the ſpiritual Parent; let them know, I have borrowed this ſharpneſs from S.

            <p>And now I beſeech you, my dear friends, and Pariſhioners, to entertain theſe poor labours of mine, as they are ſent to you, from the tender bowels of your ſpiritual ſhepherd, which may be followed with more, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the candour and benignity of their reception.

            <p>Fourthly, With the Continuance, we have here a very dangerous Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Iudgement; A Iudgement not of blaſting, or mildew upon the fields or of murrain upon the flocks; not upon the goodly pillars of the land, Religion, and Iudicature, by removing them out of their places, not upon the perſon of their King, <hi>(the joy of their hearts, and the breath of their noſtrils)</hi>

There is no plague like unto that of the heart.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, This infatuation is made by <hi>Prophets,</hi> partly by <hi>falſe Prophets;</hi> (na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely) by the ſeduction of their falſe and byaſſed viſions, and partly, by <hi>true Prophets;</hi> namely by the hardning power of the divine <hi>Oracles,</hi> on thoſe, that rebel againſt the convincement of that ſacred light.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:153007:28"/>
            <p>And laſtly. We may obſerve the <hi>Time,</hi> when this ſad meſſage was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Prophet, and by him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced unto the people; and that was, <hi>In the ſame yeer that good King Vzziah died,</hi> v. 1. A King, that had deſerved well of his people, and of whoſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment none had cauſe to complain, unleſſe it were the <hi>Prieſt</hi> in one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; which is more then our <hi>Clergy</hi> could complain of in all the raign of our bleſſed <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who fell not ſo much the <hi>peoples</hi> martyr, as the <hi>Prieſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all which particulars, the Viſion of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is ſo viſible a character of theſe times, that any man that is not involved in this Iudgement of Infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may run and read it: Which I mention for no other end, but to ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum and awake the ſenſleſs and ſecure of our Age and Nation, who never think themſelves in danger, till the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But before I proceed to my main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment, it will not be amiſs (by way of Preface or Introduction) to touch a little upon ſuch general obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as do naturally ariſe from theſe words of the Prophet; wherein we ſhall find great variety of conſiderable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as firſt, from the Prophets Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion <hi>[Go, and tell this people,</hi> &amp;c.] we have this clear Truth hinted unto us.</p>

            <p>This I take to be the <hi>obduration</hi> of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, ſo frequently mentioned in the book of Exodus. For it is ſaid Exod. 8. 15. When Pharaoh ſaw, that there was reſpite, he hardned his heart, and harkned not, &amp;c. and v. 32.

The ground, and foundation of this doctrine; I conceive, may be ſafely laid upon that maxime of our Saviour. <hi>Habenti dabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> To him that hath, ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance; But whoſoever hath not, (that is hath not improved his talent) from him ſhall be taken away, even that which he <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 12.</note> ſeemeth to have.

            <p>Secondly, We are in the next place to look upon the cauſe of this diſeaſe, and what is particularly inſtrumental unto it. We ſay in Philoſophy, <hi>Anim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As there is no <hi>diſeaſe</hi> in the <hi>body,</hi> ſo there is no <hi>diſtemper</hi> or depravity in the <hi>mind,</hi> but is the effect and product of a certain particular cauſe. So that as Infatuation of mind is a certain prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative unto judgement: ſo there are certain preparatives and prediſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Infatuation of mind.</p>
            <p>Two ſorts of evils there are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the general; God himſelf may be ſaid to harden, according to that of the Apoſtle, Rom. 9. 8. <hi>Whom he will, he hardneth;</hi> Not by any poſitive <hi>operation</hi> upon the mind (as was ſaid before) but by a privative withdrawing or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of <hi>Grace.</hi> No o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>herwiſe, then as wax being taken from the fire, from being ſoft and pliable, returns to its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural hardneſſe, and inflexibility. And this is the juſt permiſſion of Almighty God, that ſuch as will not conform unto him, and walk in his ways; ſhould be

            <p>For <hi>Inſtrumental Cauſes,</hi> there are many. To inſtance in ſome few, for all the reſt.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:153007:69"/> falſe Prophet, are all of a piece, and all of a chain, Rev. 16. 13. The bottomleſſe pit is all their homes, their ſpirits are all unclean ſpirits, and indeed, they have very little reaſon to pretend to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of truth and holines, who thus noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly abuſe his ſacred oracles, to their own particular ends and aims, as if the word of God (which ought to be the rule of faith, &amp; a good life) were a rule of lead, to be bowed at pleaſure, to our own licentious humors &amp; inclinations.</p>
            <p>But all this perhaps, may be thought to be a declamation as full of bitterneſs as boldneſſe. The falſe Prophets will declame againſt falſe prophets as faſt as any; and if the appeal be made unto the people, 'tis more then probable, that Zedechiah the falſe prophet, will have <note place="margin">1 Kin 22 Jer. 28.</note> the better of Micaiah the true; Hana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niah the falſe, will prevail over Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah the true: The falſe prophets, as they carry the greateſt confidence, ſo commonly the greateſt plauſibility with the people. We read in ſacred Hyſtorie, that a man of God hath been miſtaken in a man of God; The man of God that was ſent to propheſie againſt the Altar at Bethel, was deceived and <note place="margin">1 King. 13. 18. 1 Cor. 14 32.</note> abuſed by the old prophet that dwelt at Bethel. And although <hi>the ſpirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets;</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:153007:69"/> that is, ſubject to their examination and cenſure; yet we do not in theſe days, pretend to ſuch a ſpirit of diſcerning, but that one prophet may be eaſily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in another; And therefore it will concern us to look out for ſome <hi>kriteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> a character or mark, whereby we may receive ſatiſfaction in this particular.</p>
            <p>And certainly, we cannot have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then that which our Saviour hath left upon record, Mat. 7. 15. <hi>Beware of falſe Propbets, which come to you in ſheeps clothing, but inwardly they are ravning wolves.</hi> Hypocriſie, and cruelty or covetouſneſſe (for both are implyed in the wolviſh diſpoſition) are ſhrewd ſymptoms of a falſe prophet; but this deſcription is not concluding enough, and therefore its added v. 20. <hi>By their fruits ye ſhall know them</hi> But it may fal under a quere, what is here meant by <hi>fruits?</hi> for if by <hi>fruits</hi> in this place, we ſhall underſtand mens <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> as they are expreſt in the outward converſation, then this can be no good <hi>kriterion:</hi> for the lives of many ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox and able preachers, may poſſibly be blemiſh'd with divers <hi>frailties, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,</hi> and <hi>inadvertencies;</hi> The truth of our doctrine doth not depend upon the integrity of our converſation: there may be Iacobs voice in the pulpit, and the

            <p>Secondly, A tender heart, as it is a ſenſible; ſo it is alwayes a pliable and yeilding heart: Like wax, it may be moulded into any form, will receive any impreſſion.

            <p>The firſt potion then, I would preſcribe for the recovery of an Infatuared Spirit, is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding bitter one, and yet it muſt be taken; what it wants in ſweetneſſe, it hath in Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brity.

And would you know the reaſon how the diſeaſe in this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came to be thus deſperate; the ſame Prophet will inform ye, Jer. 6. 14. <hi>They have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people ſlightly, ſaying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace.</hi> They skinned the wound, without ſearching it to the quick, and leſt the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in the bottom, which made the wound to feſter inwardly, and to grow deſperate and incurable. So that, the firſt ſtep to the cure of the infatuated ſpirit, is, to deal impartially with the diſeaſe; The beſt expedient to bring a man to believe and rely on Chriſt for life and ſalvation; is, to repreſent cleerly his condition out of Chriſt, to be an eſtate of death and damnation, And the more we are aſhamed and confounded at the ſight of our own ugly ſelves, the more amiable and acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable we ſhall appear in the ſight of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>

Doeſt thou love him for the pious and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Enclinations thou findeſt in him? if thou doeſt; Be of good Comfort.

            <p>So that Love being the pulſe that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent us ſpiritually alive or dead; The Criſis, that determines of our diſeaſes, whether they be Curable or not; let us ever have a wary eye upon all ſuch things, as eject and deſtroy Love, and therefore (as grievances unto the Holy ſpirit of Love) Let all bitterneſſe, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be put away with all malice. Eph. 4. 31.

In the prevention of which all that can be done by them, or further adviſed by me is but this. That they would ſeaſonably entertain that councel which the prophet Daniel gave to King Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar, when a judgement was gone out againſt him, namely, To <hi>break of their ſins</hi> by <hi>right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſſe, and their Iniquities,</hi> by <hi>ſhewing mercy to the poor.</hi> That they would according to our <hi>Saviours</hi> advice, <hi>make themſelves friends</hi> of the <hi>Mammon</hi> of <hi>unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> That they would not think it a piece of <hi>Popery,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate their Repentance, by Reſtitution, and Satisfaction, as farre as may be. And if a Compenſation cannot be made in <hi>Specie,</hi> as to particular injuries, and oppreſſions; yet they have an object large enough if they pleaſe to look upon it; Indeed, I know not well how they ſhould be able to look of it.
